# Clean Simple S.O.L.I.D

This is intended to be an example API that demonstrates the clean architecture pattern with a rich domain model that uses bounded contexts.
Using a ToDo list as the example doesn't really demonstrate the full power of this pattern with a rich domain model
but hopefully it will be good enough to help people understand why this should be the default starting point for any modern application.

## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a way of using the SOLID rules to structure your projects.
